## Constructing Requests

Unless otherwise specified, all request URIs should be appended to the following base URL:

`https://api.x-on.app`

## Status Codes

Each API may document specific status codes and provide a specific reason for returning that status code. This is a general overview of the status codes you may expect from an API and what they will mean to you.

Code | Description
---- | -----------
200 OK | The request was successful. The response will contain a JSON body.
400 Bad Request | The request was invalid and/or malformed. The response will contain JSON describing the specific errors.
401 Unauthorized | You did not supply a valid Authorization header. The header was omitted or your API key was not valid. The response will be empty. See [Authentication](#authentication).
404 Not Found | The object you requested doesnâ€™t exist. The response will be empty. Retry the request 
429 Too Many Attempts | Too many requests have been made within a short time period. Retry the request after the number of seconds indicated in the `Retry-After` header. 
500 | There was an internal error. The response will be empty. This is generally a server error condition. If possible, please open a GitHub Issue so we can help you resolve the issue.
503 Service Unavailable | The requested action cannot be completed right now due server load or maintenance. Retry the request later, or after the number of seconds indicated in the `Retry-After` header.
