# Introduction

The Surgery Connect Backend is a collection of cloud services that act as a communication channel between the Surgery Connect patient apps, and Surgery Connect staff apps.

These APIs provides features for communicating and interacting with patients:

- Make a VoIP call to a patient (for patients using the Surgery Connect mobile app).
- Request one or more files from a patient, and be notified when they respond.
- Send a message with file attachments to a patient, optionally allowing them to respond in a 2-way text conversation.
- Upload files to share with a patient or staff member, and download them (or a custom sized thumbnail, in the case of image files).
- Create & manage patient appointments, and be notified when patients self-schedule, cancel, or arrive for an appointment.

These backend services are still under review/development, and as such this documentation is subject to change.
